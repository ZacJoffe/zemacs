# zemacs

My personalized Emacs configuration, inspired by Doom Emacs.

## Features
- `straight.el` for package manager

## TODOs
- Add missing functionality
- More comments/documentation
  - Potentially use org mode to handle this
- Split up into different files (or logically separate configuration within `init.el`)
- Flesh out readme once happy with config
